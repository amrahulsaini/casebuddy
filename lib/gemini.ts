SITUATION: The seller uploaded a photo of their ACTUAL PHYSICAL CASE they want to sell. They want to show what this case looks like when "${phoneModel}" phone is inserted into it.

STEP 1: Research "${phoneModel}" phone specs
- Camera count (2, 3, 4, 5?)
- Torch light? (yes/no)
- Camera arrangement (vertical, grid, etc.)
- Camera position (top-left, center, etc.)

STEP 2: Analyze the ACTUAL case in the uploaded image
- What does THIS SPECIFIC case look like?
- Material/color (black frame with clear center, fully clear, solid black?)
- Camera cutout shape and position
- Any design patterns or branding on the case

STEP 3: Describe insertion
- How will ${phoneModel} look when inserted into THIS EXACT case from the image
- Where cameras align with case cutout
- What parts of phone are visible

Return JSON:

export function buildBoundingBoxPrompt(): string {
  return `You will receive a single composite product image that may contain between 2 and 8 separate phone-case product shots (sub-images) arranged in an arbitrary layout.

Your task:
- Find each distinct sub-image (each separate phone/case view or tile).
- For each one, return a tight-fitting bounding box around that sub-image.

Coordinates:
- Use normalized coordinates relative to the full image size.
- x, y = top-left corner, as floats in [0, 1].
- width, height = box size, as floats in (0, 1].
- Do not make width or height zero.
- Ensure boxes do not overlap heavily; each sub-image should be isolated.

Return STRICT JSON with this exact structure:

Rules:
- Do NOT output any explanation text.
- Do NOT include markdown.
- Always return at least one region.`;
